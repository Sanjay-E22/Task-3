# Task-3: Data Extraction with SQL

This task focuses on extracting and querying data from a relational database using basic and advanced SQL `SELECT` statements. The queries are written using standard SQL syntax compatible with **MySQL** or **SQLite**.

---

## âœ… Objective

- Practice `SELECT` statements for retrieving data
- Use filters like `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`, and `BETWEEN`
- Apply sorting with `ORDER BY`
- Use `LIMIT` to control result size

| `AND` / `OR`     | Combine multiple conditions                      |
| `LIKE`           | Pattern matching in text                         |
| `BETWEEN`        | Filter using a range                             |
| `IS NULL`        | Identify missing data                            |
| `ORDER BY`       | Sort results in ascending/descending order       |
